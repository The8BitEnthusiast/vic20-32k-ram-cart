# A 32K RAM Expansion PCB and 3D Printed Cart for the VIC-20
After building Ben Eater's 6502 breadboard computer, I undertook this project to see how hard it would be to upgrade the RAM of my VIC-20. After all, the VIC-20 is basically a BE6502 in a case with a video chip and a keyboard. This was also an opportunity to learn how expansion cartridges are designed.
